# [PyDSV - decision space visualisation toolbox](http://www.ohoralab.com/)
[Decision spaces](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02210) are visually rich representations of decision making data. Any experimental data on mouse/hand tracking can potentially benefit from decision space visualisations. The project is currently in active development, stay tuned for updates!

# [PyDSV - decision space visualisation toolbox](http://www.ohoralab.com/)
[Decision spaces](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02210) are visually rich representations of decision making data. Any experimental data on mouse/hand tracking can potentially benefit from decision space visualisations. We build the project up on [NumPy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/)/[SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) framework and use [Pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) to handle data manipulation. Another key dependencies are [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)

The project is currently in active development, stay tuned for updates!
